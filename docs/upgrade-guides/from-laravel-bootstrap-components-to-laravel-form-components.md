# Upgrade from okipa/laravel-bootstrap-components to okipa/laravel-form-components

This package is a full rewrite of the [okipa/laravel-bootstrap-components](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-bootstrap-components) package.

This rewrite has been made for the following reasons:
* Migrating to a new repository with a name that would give a better representation of the package purpose
* Allowing choosing which UI framework is used to render components
* Taking advantage of the power of X Blade components
* Migrating code to PHP 8.0
* Adding Livewire compatibility
* Adding a form component which would allow global model binding and global Livewire configuration

Follow the steps below to upgrade the package.
